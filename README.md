Visualizing a network
The two computers are both connected to the router, either through a ethernet cable or a wireless connection. The computers send and recieve packets to the router which controls the entire networks communication to and from eacother and the internet. If either computer needs to print anything this request will go through the router and be sent to the printer, also using a wireless connection to the router.
